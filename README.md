# Facebook Clone 

## Project Description 

As part of my set of website clones, I built an imitation of the Facebook homepage. I used this project to refine my skills in plain CSS as well as using the bootstrap libraries to assist with components. 

As I go on and update I will add functionality to the page, and a database allowing users to log on and write comments.

### Limitations 

* The image I am retrieving from the database are small so when enlarged to fit the posts, appear very pixelated. 

* The icons used were generic icons from a member on github as I could not find Facebook SVGs. When I find Facebook SVGs I will add them to the page.

## Project config

* React 
* Bootstrap
